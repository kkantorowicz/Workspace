Is it better to use local installation files for stuff like jQuery, Bootstrap... etc?

Is $(document).ready necessary if you use defer on the script tag in the HTML... Perhaps just good coding?

I get the sense that frameworks like Angular and Bootstrap are intended to keep the developer out of files other 
    than the main html file as much as possibe.  IE: css and js...
